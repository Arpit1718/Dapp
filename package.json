  "description": "Welcome to our project that combines the power of Ethereum smart contracts and React to create a decentralized ATM (DApp). In this project, I'll guide you through the process of developing a user-friendly interface that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum hardhat blockchain. This DApp will allow users to perform actions like depositing and withdrawing funds, checking ownership, and accessing real-time data such as their account balance and the current timestamp.",
